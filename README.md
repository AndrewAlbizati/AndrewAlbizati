# Hi, I’m Andrew 👋

I’m a **Computer Science & Mathematics** student at the **University of San Diego** with a strong interest in **software engineering**, **artificial intelligence**, and **algorithmic problem solving**. I enjoy building systems that are both technically rigorous and practically useful: from low-level programming to full-stack and machine learning applications.

## Technical Focus
- **Programming:** Python, Java, C/C++, C#, SQL, JavaScript
- **Software Engineering:** APIs, backend systems, CI/CD, testing, automation
- **AI & Data:** Machine learning, computer vision, NLP, statistical analysis
- **Systems & Theory:** Algorithms, data structures, computer systems, optimization

## Experience Snapshot
- **System Test Automation Intern @ Philips** -- building Python tools, OCR/AI pipelines, and internal dashboards  
- **Lead Support Technician (USD ITS Help Desk)** -- technical leadership, tooling, and large-scale problem solving  
- **Undergraduate Researcher** -- computational geometry & high-dimensional data analysis  

## Interests
Algorithms • AI/ML • Systems programming • Sports analytics • Mathematical modeling • Vinyl record collecting
